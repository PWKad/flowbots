## What is a flow?

A conversation is a flow.  When we say things they trigger reactions or responses.  In computer programming we often look at problems logically as a linear chain of interactions.

A flow is different.  A flow can easily change directions or go off on tangents, just like real conversations.  To facilitate this, we built a bot maker that's more than just a scripted conversation.

A flow learns from it's creator and users.  It can learn from all users separate as each users teaches the flow how they like to interact with it.  This personalizes the experience.


## What can become a flow?

### Transcriber

Transcribe while you talk or while you listen.  can passively record and transcribe a call or a Podcast.


### TeamChatBots

Bots designed specifically for teams to collaborate.

#### Notes

Note taking bots for free that store all notes on your mobile device and give the option of sharing to desktop.  Great for teams that commute and want to maximize the time on the way in as preparation for the day to get a good list in place of what to do.  Helps teams maximize employee effectiveness as well by allowing the team to be productive during commute and more effective when in the office, usually leading to less hours commuting because you can leave work earlier and continue working on the way home as well.

#### Behavior Description

Product team can use it on the way in to the office to create behavior acceptance criteria for the application to help with the development cycle.  When the person makes it to work they can easily send the notes to their e-mail.

#### TeamChatRooms

Like Gitter / Slack but where multiple bots show up and each bot represents the owner.  They say what the owner is typing or saying in the room.  The second option for the UI is the transcript.


### TrainingFlows

People can create training experiences that allow others to research a topic.  This can be used as a social interaction when communiting or to simply learn.  An example is the Aurelia documentation.  If the bot can parse the markdown and create triggers based on the formatting (ex. h1 is the root action, then h2's are the next set of available actions)


### LearningFlows

Anyone can learn from Wikipedia by parsing the documents and then diving deeper in to the information.  In this case a custom content creator is needed and the bot simply is the interaction with the content.  This is a great example of creating the content as a flow that anyone can interact with.

### SocialBots

Bots that people create to talk to each other.  Can be used to find out more information about the user.  When a user is asked questions they get them and have the ability to create new triggers from them.  This can be learned to find out new information about people.  An example "What is your favorite movies?" becomes a new possible trigger, and when the person answers it others can now learn from them.



A flow can be anything that anyone can imagine (with limitations of course).  Think of any complex series of questions and answers -

It begins with an initial probe.  Then the response triggers an action which typically performs some command or some logic.

Think about when someone asks you if you are hungry.  If you respond yes, they might suggest some places to eat.  If you respond no, they may bring up a new question.

But what if you respond something completely new that they've never heard of before, and the receiver of the information was able to learn from this and respond to future interactions the same way.


## Example flows

1. Flows for commuting
  a. Notes taking
  b. Project management
  c. Webpage scraper
  d. Cognitive services


## Whats the competitive advantage?

The creation of the flows is superior.  Anyone can build a flow with no programming experience.
It focuses on making our least productive times our most productive.
The learning sequence is simple and easy to understand.
The flows build themselves out from user interaction so it's truly a learning experience.


## What's the exit strategy?

Utilize cognitive services and get bought.








## TrainingFlows

Anyone can create a flow to train others.  This can include question and answers, general topics and information, and can be used to train others on any topic.  An example would be an Aurelia training flow that allows training different members of a technical staff on why Aurelia is a good choice.  This could include highlighting benefits that sound good for a CTO as well as developer differences.


## LearningFlows

Learn from any parsable document.  A parser / scraper goes over the page and identifies probable nested categories.  Any learning content can be used to create a flow.  Each flow can be tagged.  Think of Khan Academy content that can be available via voice while the person commutes.


## TeamChatBots

Bots designed for team collaboriation.  Hooks in to Slack or other Chat applications to provide a hands-free option of reading current messages or creating new messages.  Each team member can choose their own bot as well.


## SocialBots

Bot rooms where each person can visualize the other bots in the room.  When each bots owner talks that bot begins speaking.  Each of the transmissions are done by passing text around instead of the voice wav files.  The chat room can exist on new chat application or existing solutions such as Slack.


## Transcriber

Transcribes meetings directly for you.  Can read back as well.  Can transcribe while you talk or while you listen.  Can passively record the text of a call or a PodCast for listeners.  Can be used to transcribe podcasts to hearing impaired.
